**Title**:

Becoming 10x engineer in the name of DevOps

**Abstract:** Have you seen these job advertisements which look like the whole IT Department description? You need to know: MySQL, UrSQL, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, CI, TDD, React, Java, OWASP, Azure & AWS, and dark magic.

Do you recall network architects, storage engineers, operations teams? Do you remember these good old pre-Kube times when people weren't forced to be full-full-stack and instantly know every bit of infrastructure management in the name of DevOps? What happened to all of that complexity in the Kube-oriented world?

In this session, we will roast and challenge these questions. Can someone be a Kube full-full stack without overflowing?

I will take you on a journey through the list of methodologies and tools which help you become that 10x engineer. We will land onto DevOps culture, product mindset, T-shaped engineers, and the tools that might enable you to become a better developer the first day you come back to tinkering with software after the conference!
