**Title**:

Scale from being a 1x Developer to being a whole IT department

**Abstract:** Have you seen these job advertisements which look like the whole IT Department description? You need to know: MySQL, UrSQL, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, CI, TDD, React, Java, OWASP, Azure & AWS, and dark magic.

Do you recall network architects, storage engineers, operations teams? Do you remember these good old pre-Kube times when people weren't forced to be full-full-stack and instantly know every bit of infrastructure management in the name of DevOps? What happened to all of that complexity in the Kube-oriented world?

In this session, we will roast and challenge these questions. Can someone be a Kube full-full stack without overflowing?

I will take you on a journey through the list of methodologies and tools which help you become that 10x engineer. We will land onto DevOps culture, product mindset, T-shaped engineers, and the tools that might enable you to become a better developer the first day you come back to tinkering with software after the conference!

**Any supporting material you would like to share with the reviewers like videos, slides etc**

A livestream I did back in the day with tech influencer Francesco Ciulla on the topic of Portainer. This might give you an idea of my speaking skills with roughly no preparation, and the type of content I've created in the past for the community. The talk I submit is more a reflection of my thoughts on the industry, which turns into a list of actions to be taken to become a better engineer in that Kube-oriented space.

**Bio:**

Dimko is that geeky tech guy. He did the whole cycle of software engineering for distributed systems, repeated for 5 years. He has built Lviv .NET Community, a geek party of over 1000 people in Ukraine, sharing their experiences at meetups and conferences. 

Now, Dimko builds up love around Kubernetes communities and Portainer.

Besides doing software-related things, you can find Dimko cycling on his road bikes or hiking in the Carpathian Mountains with his awesome dog.
