**Title**:

Could/Should you scale from being 1x Developer to being whole IT department?

**Abstract:**
Have you seen these job advertisements which look like whole IT Department description? You need to know: MySQL, UrSQL, Bash, Docker, CI, TDD, React, Java, OWASP, Azure & AWS, and dark magic. Would be a plus if you have experience breaking honeycomb into template shape. 

In this session, we are going to roast and challenge these job descriptions, discussing why they are getting created in the first place, why and when they might actually make some sense. A good bunch of memes included.

I will take you on a journey through the list of methodologies and tools which enable you to become that 10x engineer who creates solutions, not just sits in front of computer. We are going to land onto DevOps culture, product mindset, T-shaped engineers, and the tools which might enable you to become a better developer the first day you come back to tinkering with software after the conference! 

**Benefits to the ecosystem:**

With this talk, we are influencing the industry into less siloed environments where an engineer is able to make bigger impact. There are a lot of CNCF and not so much tools that enable engineers to do more. Highlighting these tools and methodologies helps us grow a healthy community of successful software engineers. 

**Bio:**

Dimko is that geeky tech guy. He did whole cycle of software engineering for distributed systems, repeated for 5 years. He has built Lviv .NET Community which is a geek party of over 1000 people in Ukraine, sharing their experiences. 

Now, Dimko builds up love around Kubernetes communities and Portainer.

Other than doing software related things, you can find Dimko cycling on his road bikes, or hiking in the Carpathian Mountains with his awesome dog.
