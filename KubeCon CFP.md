**Title**:

Could/Should you scale from being a 1x Developer to being a whole IT department?

**Abstract:** Have you seen these job advertisements which look like the whole IT Department description? You need to know: MySQL, UrSQL, Bash, Docker, CI, TDD, React, Java, OWASP, Azure & AWS, and dark magic. Would be a plus if you have experience breaking honeycomb into template shape. 

Do you recall network architects, storage engineers, operations teams? Do you remember these good old pre-Kube times where people weren't forced to be full-full-stack and instantly know every bit of infrastructure management in the name of DevOps? What happened to all of that complexity in the Kube-oriented world? 

In this session, we will roast and challenge these questions, discussing why such job descriptions exist, how they might become dangerous for everybody, and when they make sense. Can someone be a Kube full-full stack without overflowing? 

I will take you on a journey through the list of methodologies and tools which enable you to become that 10x engineer who creates solutions, not just sits in front of the computer. We will land onto DevOps culture, product mindset, T-shaped engineers, and the tools that might enable you to become a better developer the first day you come back to tinkering with software after the conference! 

**Benefits to the ecosystem:**

With this talk, we are influencing the industry into less siloed environments where an engineer can make a more significant impact, still understanding and tackling the enormous complexity of running modern distributed systems. There are a lot of CNCF and not so much tools that enable engineers to do more. Highlighting these tools and methodologies helps us grow a healthy community of successful software engineers. 

**Bio:**

Dimko is that geeky tech guy. He did the whole cycle of software engineering for distributed systems, repeated for 5 years. He has built Lviv .NET Community, a geek party of over 1000 people in Ukraine, sharing their experiences at meetups and conferences. 

Now, Dimko builds up love around Kubernetes communities and Portainer.

Besides doing software-related things, you can find Dimko cycling on his road bikes or hiking in the Carpathian Mountains with his awesome dog.
