**Title**:

Could/Should you scale from being a 1x Developer to being a whole IT department?

**Abstract:** Have you seen these job advertisements which look like the whole IT Department description? You need to know: MySQL, UrSQL, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, CI, TDD, React, Java, OWASP, Azure & AWS, and dark magic.

Do you recall network architects, storage engineers, operations teams? Do you remember these good old pre-Kube times when people weren't forced to be full-full-stack and instantly know every bit of infrastructure management in the name of DevOps? What happened to all of that complexity in the Kube-oriented world?

In this session, we will roast and challenge these questions. Can someone be a Kube full-full stack without overflowing?

I will take you on a journey through the list of methodologies and tools which help you become that 10x engineer. We will land onto DevOps culture, product mindset, T-shaped engineers, and the tools that might enable you to become a better developer the first day you come back to tinkering with software after the conference!

**Benefits to the ecosystem:**

With this talk, we are influencing the industry into less siloed environments where an engineer can make a more significant impact, still understanding and tackling the enormous complexity of running modern distributed systems. There are a lot of CNCF and not so much tools that enable engineers to do more. Highlighting these tools and methodologies helps us grow a healthy community of successful software engineers. 

**Bio:**

Dimko is that geeky tech guy. He did the whole cycle of software engineering for distributed systems, repeated for 5 years. He has built Lviv .NET Community, a geek party of over 1000 people in Ukraine, sharing their experiences at meetups and conferences. 

Now, Dimko builds up love around Kubernetes communities and Portainer.

Besides doing software-related things, you can find Dimko cycling on his road bikes or hiking in the Carpathian Mountains with his awesome dog.
