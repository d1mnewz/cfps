**Bio:**
Dimko is that geeky tech guy. He did the whole cycle of software engineering for distributed systems, repeated for 5 years. He has built Lviv .NET Community, a geek party of over 1000 people in Ukraine, sharing their experiences at meetups and conferences.

Now, Dimko builds up love around Kubernetes communities and Portainer.

Besides doing software-related things, you can find Dimko cycling on his road bikes or hiking in the Carpathian Mountains with his awesome dog 🐶.
